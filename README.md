# OLEANJI-FUTURE-DAO VOTING DAPP


using other projects as templates i start the journey i talked about in my last repo.
this is the first phase into the voting system where by people can add their addresses to the candidate list to be voted for:

later possible improvement :
---adding names and address
----uploading of picture into the ipfs
---etc
```
